        My journey started with a passion for technology and a desire to make a
        difference. I'm a self-taught developer who has been coding since I
        started my journey in 2020 at Tata Elxsi. I'm a quick learner and I'm
        always looking to improve my skills. I'm a team player and I'm always
        looking to help my team succeed. <br /><br />Currently, I'm a student at
        California State University, Fullerton, pursuing a Master's degree in
        Computer Science. I specialize in Software Engineering and Artificial
        Intelligence. I'm looking for new opportunities to work with a team of
        passionate developers and make a difference in the world.
